# üëã Hello there!
I am Francesco, I am passionate about geospatial data, satellite imagery and data science. My work focuses on satellite data analysis, computer vision, and deep learning techniques for Earth Observation.
Beyond my professional focus and interests, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects and building Linux-based systems and solutions for self-hosted sercives, networking and more.
Here you will find some projects I have worked on that I can publicly share. 

## üí° My tech skills
- ML/DL for Earth Observation with Python (PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, TorchGeo, scikit-learn, Optuna, Jupyter Lab)
- Computer Vision with Python (OpenCV, scikit-image, Pillow)
- Geoscripting with Python and R (GDAL/OGR, GeoPandas, rasterio, terra, sf)
- Data analysis and manipulation with Python and R (NumPy, Pandas, statsmodels, scipy, dplyr)
- Google Earth Engine and geemap
- Data visualization with Python and R (matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot)
- GIS desktop applications (ArcGIS, QGIS) and related APIs (ArcPy, PyQGIS)
